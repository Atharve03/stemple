A worldwide controversy erupted when Catholics insisted that the performance would constitute hate speech because they believe the Black Mass mocks Catholic rituals and they erroneously argued the ceremony promotes evil. Due to the overwhelming demand to see the Black Mass, the event was moved to a location that could accommodate more people.
